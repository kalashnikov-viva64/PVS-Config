The batch file PVS-Analyse.bat is used to perform static code analysis with the PVS-Studio tool.

Usage: PVS-Analyse.bat <Platform> <DelayMinutes>
<Platform> - Platform x86 or x64
<DelayMinutes> - Analysis runtime in minutes

We used a set of methods to increase reliability of the static analysis:
•	3 analysis attempts,
•	*.plog report creation check,
•	Forced Visual Studio shutdown after the time out,
•	Removal of Visual Studio temporary files
